# Code Quiz

This project is a simple quiz to test the users knowledge of JavaScript. The user clicks the start button and has 120 seconds to answer 10 questions. For every wrong answer they are deducted 5 seconds. At the end they are asked to enter in a moniker for the "High Score" board. This is a time-based, multiple-choice quiz with dynamically updated HTML and CSS using JavaScript.
